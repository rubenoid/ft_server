## Subject
- You canâ€™t use docker-compose.
- You must set up a web server with Nginx, in only one docker container. The
container OS must be debian buster.

will be a WordPress website, phpMyAdmin and MySQL. You will need to make
sure your SQL database works with the WordPress and phpMyAdmin.

- You will have to make sure that, depending on the url, your server redirects to the
correct website.
- You will also need to make sure your server is running with an autoindex that must
be able to be disabled.
